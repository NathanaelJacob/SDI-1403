<p>I wanted to continue to evolve my theme from last week and build upon it. I am really comfortable with my story and instead of starting from scratch, I wanted to be able to incorporate all of the new things I have learned this week into a usuable assignment. In the future as I become more familiar with using Javascript, I plan on expanding my themes to more complex ones.</p>
