    <h2>Project 2</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>I chose my theme because I wanted to continue showing the necessary steps when doing household chores.I think it is important to understand what we do and how we do it, not matter how simple the task may be. I try to put myself into another persons shoes, who may not have every used a washing machine due to the inability to obtain one. That person will have no idea where to start, so I want to provide that person with the necessary instructions to keep their clothes clean.</p>
